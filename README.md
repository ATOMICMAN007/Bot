# KyotSheep
This is my biggest bot so far and has most amount of features.

I'm really new to coding so you might wanna puke after looking at the code.
Also feel free to steal it and make it your own! (Why am I even saying this. Those who wanna copy will copy anyways. LOL)

# Installation
As far as documentation goes, I'm lazy enough for now not to make any.
### Dependecies
Install:
1. `discord.py` (rewrite)

2. Make a `.env` file and add `TOKEN="<YOU BOT TOKEN HERE>"`

Optional:
3. `discord-pretty-help`

Makes the default help command look really cool.

Note: If you want the default help command or using your own custom one, then remove-

a. `help_command=PrettyHelp()` from `Bot()` in `main.py`. 

b. `from pretty_help import PrettyHelp` in `main.py`.

## DO NOT REVEAL YOUR BOT TOKEN BY ANY MEANS
